    We are a team of four Information Technology students currently studying at the University of Science and Technology,
    Faculty of Computer Science.
    
    As third-level students, we are building our academic and practical knowledge in the field of Information Technology.
    The Portfolio Team project represents part of our learning journey, where we apply the concepts we study in web design
    and basic front-end development.
    
    Our Portfolio Team focuses on designing clean and simple user interfaces using HTML and CSS.
    Through this project, we aim to present well-structured static web pages that demonstrate proper layout, visual
    organization, and ease of use.
    
    Working together as the Portfolio Team has helped us improve our collaboration skills, time management, and understanding
    of how academic team projects are planned and implemented.
    
    This portfolio reflects our efforts, creativity, and commitment to learning and improving our technical skills as future
    IT professionals.
